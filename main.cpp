/*Create the variables, “playerOne”, ”playerTwo”, “randomNumber”, “playerGuess”, and “currentPlayer”
Ask the first person their name and store that into the variable “playerOne”
Ask the second person their name and store that into variable “playerTwo”
Generate a random number between 1 and 100 and store that into the variable “randomNumber”
Tell the players to flip a coin.
Prompt the player who won and store it into “currentPlayer”
Start a loop for player turns
In the loop, prompt the current player for their guess and store it to “playerGuess”
Compare the variable “playerGuess” to “randomNumber”
If the “playerGuess” is incorrect
If “playerGuess” is less than “randomNumber”, prompt the player “Your guess is too low”
If “playerGuess” is greater than “randomNumber”, prompt the player “Your guess is too high”
If the “playerGuess” is equal to “randomNumber”
Print “end the game”
Switch to the next player by updating the “currentPlayer” and repeat steps 8-11
